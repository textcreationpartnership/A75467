            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A briefe Reply to the Declaration of the House of Commons.</head>
            <p>VVE have read your Declaration, and have thought good to give you this short account of those impressions that it hath left with us. Wee find it of that nature, that it would faine prompt others to thinke more than it selfe dares speake or utter, and yet speakes much more than it proves. But though we should take all insinuations for asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all assertions for probations, we cannot see how all together would be sufficient to bring home the conclusions: neither that which is expresly let downe as the professed drift of the whole Booke: no<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet those that it is farther to usher in: The great sinew of that Body: The maine wheele or spring of your Engine, which if any thing must doe your feat of dis-uniting the hearts of the Kingdome from his Majesty, and justifying your professed rejection of him, is that which concerneth the death of the late King. A matter indeed of a very high nature; and though you are loth to expresse your selves therein, yet it is not hard to discerne what thoughts you would thereby commend unto us. But if you can clearly make good what you intend, why did you not speake it plainly? If you cannot, why doe you goe about by malicious art to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate that which you are not able to make good? Men that are under the power of others, use indeed sometimes to speake timorous verities: But where men armed with greatnesse and strength, speake fearefully, there the Truth is in danger,</p>
            <p>But doe you beleeve, or can you thinke to perswade us, that the honour of so great a King, or his just power and Rights, are to be laid under foot upon surmises? upon quodlibeticall and uncertaine conjectures, whose grounds and foundations are rather in the conceits and apprehensions of men variable according to the variety of their affections, than in the reality of things or actions? When events are liable to divers causes, and those that have their residence within the breasts of men, to fixe them upon one without any sound reason for the choice, but because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares most serviceable to our purposes, is a fallacy of too open a collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; That we should trust our judgements with it in so great a matter; and therefore since you have proved nothing against his Majesty, in that particular, we cannot but inferre, that all that you want of evidence against him lyeth against your selves, and doth convince you to have committed as high an offence against the duty of Subjects, as against the candour of Christians.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171585:3"/>
            <p> As for us, The pious life of his Majesty; His exemplary carriage in the whole demeanour of his life. The quiet and undisturbed temper of his mind, notwithstanding the surly stormes where with he hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted: His mercy toward others, even toward his enemies, unlikely to consist with such horrid cruelty towards his owne father His constancy and undauntednesse of spirit in his sufferings, together with his great and commemorable patience; assisted with the great improbability of the act, as having in it too little an hire of advantage to procure the undertaking of so high an impietie, as that which brought a farre greater addition of burden than honour upon his back: The consideration of the deare affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between him and his Royall Father, never interrupted by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste likely to hatch such a viper in so noble a breast. These and many more together, with the highest engagement of Christian charity to our King, as they doe bind us, and even inforce us to abhominate and abhorre the thought of that thought, which you seeme to desire to infuse into us, and to keep our breasts armed and guarded, however you have or may disarme us otherwise against any insinuations that may lead us therunto:</p>
            <p>So when we consider the rules and practices of some Politicians, and the nature of man, which is observed to be such, as it is apt to hate those whom they have wronged, and to wrong them more; when we consider what hath been done already, what is dayly done, and what it is some mens interest, as the world judgeth of Interests to do: we cannot but encline to adhere rather unto this choice, to beleeve it much more likely that such a thing may be forged by some against him, than that he could commit such a thing against his Father without any such inducements either of revenge or interest: and where the guilt of this is now let the world judge, and which is the greater offence of the two.</p>
            <p>But secondly, in case it could be proved, and so fully, so demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively proved, as is requisite to overcome that large portion of Charity which is due unto a King above all other sorts of men, and to him for ought we know above all other Kings, much the more for the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein you keepe him, so clearly as to be victorions over so many and so disswasive improbabilities that present themselves in array against it: we should indeed even then admit it with great reluctancy, as a truth that it might be thought a kind of impiety to understand; wee should then (when we must needs) looke upon it as a sad and great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto our Nation, and as a great cause of humiliation (not of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph or insulting) unto us, That God should suffer our King to fall into such a depth of imprety, for the sins of the Magistrate as of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="tcp:171585:3"/>are usually the judgements of the people for their sins: But yet neverthelesse, we should hold it our duty even in that case to cry out with the holy Prophet, <hi>Micha</hi> 7.9. <hi>We will beare the indignation of the Lord, because we have sinned against him,</hi> &amp;c. And to set our selves to the duties of Fasting, and Prayers, and Teares, for the lamentation and expiation of so horrid an iniquity from his Majestie and the Kingdome. But we could not be perswaded that it were a Christian course for us to make His iniquity the countenance or excuse of ours: or admit it as a supersedeas or discharge of the bond of our allegeance, though it should render it indeed much discomfortable unto us; for as a Child owes his filiall honour and obedience not to a good Father, but to a Father, be he good or bad: so Subjects their allegiance not to a good King, but to the King: and though wee deny not but Potentates may forfeit their Crownes by their impieties, yet the holy Word of God leades us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that none is thereby enabled to take that forfeiture but God; <hi>Saul</hi> forfeited his Crowne by his Sacrilegious intrusion into the Office and Function of the Priesthood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13 8. &amp;c. and doubled that forfeiture by his disobedience unto the Command of God concerning <hi>Agag</hi> and the spoile, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9. &amp;c. And God both times proceeds to sentence against him: but yet none must take the forfeiture, nor put the Sentence in execution, till God himselfe was pleased to do it: And therefore notwithstanding all that, <hi>David</hi> durst not lift up his hand against him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. &amp; 26. <hi>David</hi> himselfe afterwards, though an holy man, yet was so far left unto himselfe for a time by God, that he fell into two horrid and unworthy finnes: base in the eyes of men as well as hainous in the sight of God: First, committing adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> at such a time when her husband whom he so vilely wronged therein, was imployed in the hazarding of his life to doe his service; and then to cover that, treacherously contriving and procuring his murther: and yet this was no good plea to justifie <hi>Absalom</hi> or the sonne of <hi>Bichri</hi> in their rebellions: no nor yet <hi>Shimei</hi> in his foule-mouthed railing against him for it: But all of them were in their times overtaken with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and <hi>David</hi> yet ended his dayes in peace, being reconciled to God by his repentance. <hi>Nero</hi> was as it were a Devill incarnate, so bad, that his wickednesse added glory to the persecutions of those that suffered by him: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> useth it as an argument to prove Christianitie to be good, because <hi>Nero</hi> opposed it: He made it his sport to see his owne Imperiall City set on fire before his face: and then when he had done, caused it most faisly and most wickedly to be laid upon the Christians.
<pb facs="tcp:171585:4"/>And embrued his hands in the bloud of his owne Mother: and yet it is observed this very <hi>Nero</hi> was then Emperour and Governour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes at that very time when Siant <hi>Paul</hi> wrote unto them to be subject unto <hi>the higher powers:</hi> and tels them withall, that <hi>whoever resists shall receive to himselfe damnation.</hi> Let not any thinke that in this we plead for the wickednesse of Kings: we are so farre from it, that as we doe beleeve the same sinnes to be more hainous in them then in other men, and that their very iniquities contract greatnesse from their greatnesse: so we know and wish they may alwayes remember that their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they take not heed, will keep the proportion too, and prove that sentence Canonicall, though it be written in the Apocrypha, <hi>that great men shall be greatly tormented,</hi> So that they shall get nothing by their impunitie from men. Neither is it for their sakes, but for others that they are so priviledged: For the preservation of Government, which is the good of the people.</p>
            <p>Nor would we wish any to imagine that we thinke these patternes of wickednes have any such paralells in his sacred Majesties story, if it may be truly set down. as some would perswade, but only to shew the unsor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblenesse of such kind of deductions as our dayes have produced: and if it may be, to prevent the like hereafter. And to shew you here, that the Kings Right unto his Crowne and Government is entire against all that you have said, though it could be made appeare (which God forbid we should imagine) and if so, than there is no ground for us either to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Allegiance from him: nor is there any justification to be found for your strange, undutifull, and we thinke unpatterned resolutions: Wherein you that are subjects, and in the highest consideration of your unlapsed Being; but the great Councell of the King have resolved, not only to make no more addresses to him, but to receive no Messages from him; so that if he should happily learne so much humility more by his sufferings, as to petition you for food or raiment, or to obtaine a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for his body, in case of sicknesse, or a Divine for his soule in another case, or in any other way wherein the good of the Kingdome may be concerned never so much; yet like the Adder you have stopt your eares against him, and forbidden all others under the danger of the penalties of Traitors (a strange punishment for such a sinne) not to receive any Messages from him, nor to make any unto him.</p>
            <p>As if to prison your King, to banish Him into an Island, to Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Him from the comforts of His Wife, His Children, His Friends, His Servants; to deprive Him of the very meanes of His Salvation,
<pb facs="tcp:171585:4"/>by denying Him the assistance of His Chaplaines: as if all this and much more were nothing, unlesse you did withall intedict Him all Society of Mankind: The monstrous injustice and cruelty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may well wish had rather been found amongst Turkes and Heathens than us: and grieve that it should pollute any Christian and English Story; But that we may save you the labour of study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or troubling your selves overmuch about the disposing of the Government of this Kingdome; we desire you to remember, that whensoever, and by what meanes soever the Lord shall please to put a period unto the Raigne of His Majesty, we are sufficiently instructed who it is that is imediately to succeed Him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; since we have not yet forgotten by His long and forced absence, that we have a Noble Prince in the world, descended from the Bloud, not only of the Ancienr Kings of these Nations, in so continued and unquestionable a descent, as is enough to stop the mouth of malice it selfe; but also from the Loines of many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forraine Kings, whose Interest God defend we should have any thought of violating, or consenting with any that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it: And whilst it is so, there is no imaginable Humane Act or accident that can put the Government of this Nation into your hands, or leave it to your disposing. So that your conclusions that you draw so hard for, that you have even broken your Geeres, stick still in the mire, and you are run away without them, gingling your Bells as if all were at your heeles: We are still to seeke for a sound Reason why the King should be secluded from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from the addresses of a Parliament unto Him, whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Essence depends upon a correspondence and Communion with Him, since it is their very Parliamentary being to be His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers; which cannot stand with a professed interception of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses unto Him, and from Him; nor yet if that were as you would have it, were we to expect a new way of Government or Governours from you. And if the Gyant and the <hi>Achilles</hi> of your Declaration, with all the allowances that can be admitted is so weake, much lesse will your purposes find a Fortresse in any thing else that you have said, which for our selves we have no power to examine; nor have we found truth and fidelity so constant a Companion with all things that have been averred with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in these times, as to depend in this upon bare averce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:171585:5"/>
               <hi>Si sat is est accusasse, quis tandem innocens?</hi> God himselfe should not be innocent, if to be accused were to be convicted; we hold it therefore most unjust and unreasonable for us to admit any of those aspersions which you have laid upon His Majesty into our beliefe, or to make any results at all upon them in the least degree prejudiciall to His Majestie in our opinions, untill we shall see as well what His Majestie can answer, as what you have objected against Him; for since it is a Justice not to be deni<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to the meanest of Subjects, nay, to the greatest slaves, that they have liberty to speake for themselves, before judgement be given upon their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: according to that wise saying of the heathen Poet:

            <p>And if it were a reasonable question that was moved by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> in the behalfe of our Saviour, <hi>Joh</hi> 7.1. <hi>Doth our Law judge any man before it heare him, and know what he saith.</hi> If this (wee say) be the Privilege of Subjects, which they ought to receive at the Tribunalls of the greatest Kings and Magistrates; fith it hath pleased you to make the People of this Land so farre the Judges betwixt His Majestie and you, as you seeme to do in your decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, although we disclaime any such power over Him, and must averre that for truth which you account for State-heresie it seemes: That <hi>His Majestie oweth an account of His Actions to none but God alone,</hi> (as unto Judges of them:) But yet since you will needs solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our judgements herein: we must tell you that we hold it a thing against all equity and right, for you to take the freedome to say what you please against His Majestie, and in the meane time to keepe him in that restraint, that He can neither know what you have objected, nor have liberty to make His Answer thereunto; We do therefore desire it of you in point of justice to His Majestie, and in regard of satisfaction to our selves, that this Declaration of yours may be speedily communicated to His Majestie, and that He may have free liberty (with the helpe of such Secretaries, and others that shall be needfull, to helpe His Memory, and to do Him other requisite service therein,) to make what Answer He shall thinke
<pb facs="tcp:171585:5"/>fit thereunto: and that the said Answer may be as freely pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and perused as this your Declaration. If you shall deny us this, we shall have so much the more reason to continue and augment our suspitions: That there was too much gall in that Inke that wrote those lines which you have sent abroad; and that they are not of such sollid matter as to endure the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and triall of a just Reply, and shall therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to banish all other impressions thereof <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom us, but of hatred unto such unrighteous practises, and that which wee shall now briefly set downe:</p>
            <p>First, That we beleeve it not a thing impossible, nor a thing to be much wondred at by us, or to stick by us in any great prejudice to His Majestie: That the sad condition and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difficulties wherewith His Majestie hath encountred through the miscarriages of others, have found Him a Man: and therefore (possibly) have driven him sometimes into some refuges that were not so proper for Him at other times, and in another temper of things: as we have observed many miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in others, no lesse temptations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in the mannage of such affaires which His Majesty hath been put upon: and in such a crowd of such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and various exigents, it was not alwaies possible for His Majestie to do all things with His owne hand, or to examine all things by His owne eye or judgement, that have passed as His Acts: many things were necessary to be committed to the trust of others: and if perhaps any of them have failed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, we dare not lay this to the charge of His Majestie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore we conceive in all equity, that His Majestie ought not to be judged of by us or His People, by the passages that have fallen out in this distemper of His Raigne. As wee judge not of the complexion of bodies in their distempers, but in their naturall and healthfull constitutions; and therefore we conceive all or the greatest part that hath fallen out in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though it did appeare (as it doth not,) ought to have been left out of your Declaration,</p>
            <p n="4">4. And then fourthly, we can remember and find so little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:171585:6"/>these times, that hath not been repaired abundantly, or satisfied by His Majestie, that we can find nothing to rest an evill thought against Him justly thereupon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we find in the recollection unto our memories, of divers passages that have of late fallen from His Majestie: That you have no such cause as you pretend to complaine of His obstruction of Peace: since wee have found Him willing as appeareth by His late Messages unto you: To sacrifice all His owne power and greatnesse upon the matter, (more for ought we find then ever any King yet offered) to the Peace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of us His People: And that the maine things that He stands upon are the Interest of His People in Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the Interest of His Sonne, and not His owne; and we should be most unthankfull should we desert Him for seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to guard us in those things which are so precious unto us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That we are upon good grounds so well perswaded of His Majestie, that we doubt not but very much of what is charged against Him will fall short of evidence: and are the issues either of mis-information or mis-interpretation.</p>
            <p>And lastly, we desire to let you know that our Allegiance is yet unmoved by this battery: so farre that we do yet desire of you the restitution of our King, and that He may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Personall Treaty, that we may enjoy againe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that happy Government which hath been so prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and comfortable unto us; And that you will not to make good your owne ends and purposes, expose us unto the hazard of another bloudy Warre, lest your selves be partakers of the evills thereof. Assuring you, that although we know not what God may permit you to force us unto otherwise by that power which you have, with other colours and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, gotten into your hands; Yet in this we shall not faile by Gods helpe; In endeavouring to preserve our Allegiance to His Majestie, and our fidelity to His Posterity after Him: Desiring only to be resolved of this one question by you at the latter end? Why the House of Lords was waved in a matter of so great concernment to the Kingdome?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171585:6"/>
            <p> We beseech God of his infinite mercy to restore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in His good time from that sad estate of affliction He is in, not only to the great hurt, but dishonour also of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that he will put some softnesse into your hearts, that you may yet thinke upon those courses that maybe for the preservation of this poore abused and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom, from an utter and finall destruction.</p>
